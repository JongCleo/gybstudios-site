            <h3>Previous Work</h3>

            <p><strong>"AI Engineering":</strong> I specialize in working closely with founders anywhere from the idea stage to the 20th pivot stage. I'll read your internal knowledge base, talk to your users and debate you on what the right thing to build. Some recent examples include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Document processing for investment analysis (founder raised tier 1 money off our prototype).</li>
                <li>Automating background research for executive search firms.</li>
                <li>AI sales coaching tools for home services.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Prior to this, I did some random stuff because I didn't have a niche. Early work involved:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>(Devtools)</strong> Contributing to open-source development with Groq Inc. on an agent building framework (like LangGraph or OpenAI's Agent SDK).</li>
                <li><strong>(Devops/Testing)</strong> Setting up browser automation testing and CI for Cerebras.</li>
                <li><strong>(Technical Content)</strong> Authoring technical content for creators like <a href="https://x.com/gregkamradt?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Greg Kamradt</a>.</li>
            </ul>

                    <blockquote>"Leo is a sharp, adaptable engineer who thrives in ambiguity.<br><br>We needed to build a complex AI-driven multi-modal UI/UX system with many moving parts, including managing LLM hallucinations. Leo quickly prototyped improvements to our Python-based reasoning engine, integrated backend systems, and built new UI/UX experiences.<br><br>I'd recommend Leo to any team looking for a full-stack engineer who can solve complex problems and deliver results."</blockquote>
